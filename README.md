  ## üéÆ How to Play

Getting started is simple! Follow these steps to play the game:

1.  **Flip a Card:**
    * Click on any card that is face down to reveal the image on it.

2.  **Find the Match:**
    * Now, click on another face-down card to see if it's a matching pair.

3.  **Check the Result:**
    * **If the cards match,** they will stay face-up. You're one step closer to winning!
    * **If they don't match,** both cards will flip back over. Try to remember their positions for your next turn!

4.  **Win the Game:**
    * Continue matching pairs until all the cards are face-up.
    * Try to finish with the fewest moves to achieve a new high score!
