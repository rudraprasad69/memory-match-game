## üéÆ How to Play

Getting started is simple! Follow these steps to play the game:

2.  **Find the Match:**
    * Now, click on another face-down card to see if it's a matching pair.

3.  **Check the Result:**
    * **If the cards match,** they will stay face-up. You're one step closer to winning!
    * **If they don't match,** both cards will flip back over. Try to remember their positions for your next turn!
