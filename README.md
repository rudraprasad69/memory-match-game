## üéÆ How to Play

1.  The goal is to click on the colored target shape as quickly as possible.
2.  A timer starts counting down as soon as the target appears.
3.  Click the target before the timer runs out to score a point and advance to the next round.
4.  Each round, the time limit gets shorter, making it more challenging.
5.  If you fail to click the target in time, the game is over.
6.  Your highest score will be saved locally.

## üêõ Known Issues & Future Improvements

- The current version does not support sound effects.
- The leaderboard is currently a static JSON file. Future work would involve a real backend for dynamic updates.
- The game's difficulty curve could be fine-tuned for a more balanced experience.
